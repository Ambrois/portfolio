![everest-vis](pics/everest-vis.png)

Dot plot showing Mount Everest expedition lengths by year, with each point representing one expedition. Successful and unsuccessful climbs are shown separately, revealing that expedition durations have become more consistent over time, with sharp drops driven by external disasters. In 2014, an ice avalanche in the Khumbu Icefall killed several Sherpas and led to the cancellation of much of the climbing season. In 2015, a large earthquake in Nepal triggered avalanches that struck Everest Base Camp, forcing most expeditions to end early.

![age-gap-mirrored](pics/age-gap-vis-1.png)

Mirrored histogram comparing age differences in movie couples based on whether the older actor is male or female. Relationships with older men tend to have larger and more varied age gaps, while relationships with older women are more tightly clustered around smaller differences.


***


![age-gap-hist](pics/age-gap-vis-2.png)

Histogram showing age differences in heterosexual movie couples, calculated as male age minus female age. Most values are positive, indicating that male actors are more often older than their female partners and by a wider range of ages.

![murder-happiness-1](pics/murder-rate-happiness-vis.png)

Scatter plot showing the relationship between murder rates and happiness scores across countries, with a fitted trend line that changes over time. Overall, higher murder rates tend to be associated with lower happiness, though the strength of this relationship varies by year.

![murder-happiness-2](pics/murder-rate-happiness-vis-2.png)

Side-by-side scatter plots comparing the real data to data simulated from a linear regression model. The plots show that the model captures the general trend but produces more tightly clustered points than those seen in the observed data.

![ugly-vis](pics/ugly-vis.png)

Plot intentionally designed to be confusing and unpleasant, with unclear labels, unnecessary transformations, and distracting visual elements. The figure illustrates how poor design choices can hide patterns and mislead viewers rather than communicate information effectively.
