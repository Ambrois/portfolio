```

![everest-vis](pics/everest-vis.png)

Dot plot of Everest expedition duration by year, split by summit success. Durations become more consistent over time, with major drops during disaster years: the 2014 Khumbu Icefall avalanche and the 2015 Nepal earthquake/avalanche season.

![age-gap-mirrored](pics/age-gap-vis-1.png)

Mirrored histogram of age gaps in movie couples by gender of the older actor. When the older actor is male, age gaps are generally larger and more variable; when the older actor is female, gaps are tighter and usually smaller.


***


![age-gap-hist](pics/age-gap-vis-2.png)

Histogram of age differences in heterosexual movie couples (male age minus female age). The distribution is mostly positive, which means men are more often older than their female co-stars, and often by larger margins.

```

![murder-happiness-1](pics/murder-rate-happiness-vis.png)

Country-level scatter plot of murder rate vs. happiness score with a fitted trend line over time. Higher murder rates are generally associated with lower happiness, though the strength of that relationship shifts year to year.

observed + predicted
```

![murder-happiness-2](pics/murder-rate-happiness-vis-2.png)

Observed vs. simulated scatter plots from a linear model. The simulation captures the overall trend but is more tightly clustered than the real data, suggesting the model underestimates variability.

![ugly-vis](pics/ugly-vis.png)

An intentionally bad chart: unclear labels, noisy styling, unnecessary transforms, and distracting annotations. The point is to show how design choices can hide signal and mislead interpretation.
