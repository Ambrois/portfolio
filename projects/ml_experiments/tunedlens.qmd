title: "Exploring Tuned Lenses via Subspace Ablations"
---

### Motivation

Tuned Lenses provide a way to map intermediate model activations into a shared predictive space aligned with the final token distribution. This experiment explored whether that lens-aligned space admits a meaningful linear decomposition into directions that directly influence output logits versus directions with little direct effect, and whether such a distinction can be probed through targeted ablations.

### Core Idea

Using a singular value decomposition of the unembedding matrix, we partitioned the lens-aligned predictive space into two subspaces: directions associated with large singular values (hypothesized to have strong influence on logits) and directions associated with small singular values (hypothesized to be weakly output-relevant). We then ablated activations within each subspace and measured changes in model predictions using KL divergence.

### Results

With pretrained Tuned Lenses, ablations of high–singular-value directions consistently produced substantially larger KL divergence than ablations of low–singular-value directions, with the effect generally increasing in later layers. In contrast, lenses trained on a small, low-quality subset of text data failed to show this separation, suggesting that the experiment is highly sensitive to lens quality and training distribution.

### Interpretation and Limitations

The results support the view that the lens-aligned space contains linearly identifiable directions with direct influence on the output distribution. However, conclusions are limited by dependence on pretrained lenses, lack of out-of-distribution validation, and the exploratory nature of the analysis. The experiment is best interpreted as a diagnostic probe of Tuned Lens behavior rather than a definitive decomposition of model computation.

### Status

This work is exploratory and incomplete. Planned extensions included propagating output-subspace importance backward through lens maps to identify circuit endpoints, but these were not completed within the available time and infrastructure constraints.
