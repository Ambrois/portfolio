### Overview

This group project was part of a Artificial Intelligence course and explored supervised learning approaches for skin cancer detection using the ISIC 2024 dataset, which consists of over 400,000 lesion images extracted from 3D total body photography along with structured metadata. The task was to classify lesions as benign or malignant in a setting characterized by extreme class imbalance (approximately 1000:1 benign to malignant). The goal was not leaderboard optimization, but to understand how standard machine learning methods behave under severe imbalance and limited signal.

### Data and Approach

We evaluated both metadata-based and image-based models. Metadata features included patient age, lesion size, and body location, which were cleaned, normalized, and encoded prior to modeling. For structured data, we implemented logistic regression (in PyTorch), random forests, and XGBoost. For image data, we trained several convolutional architectures ranging from a simple CNN to deeper models, including a ResNet-18 variant. Models were evaluated using malignant-class precision and recall rather than overall accuracy.

### Key Challenges and Findings

The dominant challenge was extreme class imbalance, which caused many models to default to predicting the benign class. We experimented with loss weighting and weighted sampling strategies to mitigate this effect; weighted sampling produced more stable training behavior but did not yield consistently strong predictive performance. Across both metadata and image models, training loss often failed to exhibit a clear downward trend, suggesting limited learnable signal under the given constraints. Some configurations achieved high recall at the expense of very low precision, limiting practical usefulness.

### Interpretation

This project highlighted the limits of standard supervised learning pipelines in highly imbalanced medical imaging tasks without substantial prior structure. The results suggest that meaningful improvements would likely require stronger inductive bias (e.g., pretrained representations, asymmetric or focal loss functions, or multi-task learning) or additional curated data. The primary contribution of this work lies in diagnosing failure modes, appropriate metric selection, and understanding when increased model complexity does not compensate for data limitations.

### Tools

Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, XGBoost, convolutional neural networks, class-imbalance handling techniques.
