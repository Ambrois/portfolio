title: "Manual Task Performance Under Distraction and Biomechanical Constraints"
---

### Overview

This project examined how cognitive distraction, screw-turning direction, and hand dominance affect performance on a constrained manual task. Participants unscrewed bolts under controlled conditions designed to mimic restricted wrist posture, allowing us to evaluate biomechanical and cognitive factors influencing task completion time.

### Data and Experimental Design

Data were collected from 57 Cal Poly students. Each participant completed four trials using all combinations of dominant vs. nondominant hand and flexion vs. extension screw direction. Distraction (mental math vs. normal background noise) was assigned between subjects. The outcome was time to fully unscrew a bolt (seconds), yielding 228 total observations. The study followed a mixed 2×2×2 factorial design with repeated measures on hand and direction.

### Methodology

We analyzed log-transformed completion times using a mixed-effects ANOVA model to better satisfy normality assumptions. Distraction, hand, and direction were treated as fixed effects, with participant modeled as a random effect to account for repeated measures. The initial model included all main effects and interactions; non-informative interaction terms were removed to improve interpretability and model fit, leaving the hand-by-direction interaction.

### Key Findings

Screw direction had a large effect on performance: extension trials were substantially slower than flexion trials. Hand dominance also mattered, with slower performance using the nondominant hand. There was moderate evidence of an interaction between hand and direction, suggesting that the nondominant-hand penalty was less pronounced during extension than flexion. Distraction showed no measurable effect on task time, nor did it interact meaningfully with hand or direction.

### Power Analysis and Design Implications

The study was well powered to detect large biomechanical effects but underpowered for small effects such as distraction or subtle hand differences. A power analysis indicated that substantially more participants would be required to reliably detect small time differences. As a result, a key recommendation is to treat distraction as a within-subject factor in future studies, which would improve efficiency and sensitivity without increasing sample size.

### Tools

R (mixed-effects modeling, ANOVA, power analysis).
