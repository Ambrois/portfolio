### Overview

Capstone consulting projects from my undergraduate statistics program.

### Projects

#### [IBaby Month One: Maternal Depression and Technology Use](ibaby.qmd)

Logistic regression on postpartum survey data. Higher parenting stress and tech-related distraction were both associated with higher depression risk after demographic controls.


#### [Sustainability Literacy: Environmental and Educational Predictors of Knowledge](sustainability.qmd)

Multiple regression on survey + census-linked features. College exposure predicted sustainability knowledge more strongly than most background variables.


#### [Manual Task Performance Under Distraction and Biomechanical Constraints](mobility.qmd)

Mixed-effects analysis of repeated manual-task trials. Hand dominance, wrist constraints, and distraction all affected performance, with power limits considered in interpretation.
