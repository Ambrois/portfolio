### Overview

These projects were completed as part of an undergraduate capstone in statistical consulting, involving real data and stakeholders.

### Projects

#### [IBaby Month One: Maternal Depression and Technology Use](ibaby.qmd)

Studied survey data from new mothers to see whether parenting stress and technology use are linked to depression one month after birth. Used a logistic regression model and found that higher stress and greater distraction were strongly associated with increased depression risk, even after accounting for basic demographic factors.


#### [Sustainability Literacy: Environmental and Educational Predictors of Knowledge](sustainability.qmd)

Studied how environmental background and education relate to sustainability knowledge, while controlling for time spent in college. Applied multiple linear regression to survey and census data and found that college-level exposure mattered more than individual background characteristics.


#### [Manual Task Performance Under Distraction and Biomechanical Constraints](mobility.qmd)

Studied how hand dominance, wrist movement, and mental distraction influence performance on a manual task. Used a mixed-effects design to account for repeated measurements and focused on interpreting results with appropriate attention to statistical power.
