title: "Sustainability Literacy: Environmental and Educational Predictors of Knowledge"
---

### Overview
This project studied what predicts students’ sustainability literacy scores (SKS), with a focus on educational exposure vs. background environment.

### Data
We combined Cal Poly survey responses with ZIP-code-linked census/environment variables.  
Outcome: sustainability knowledge score.  
Predictors: PM2.5, greenspace, fire frequency, ZIP-code area, neighborhood educational attainment, and year in college.

Sampling mixed classroom recruitment and voluntary responses, so results should not be treated as fully population-representative.

### Methodology
I fit multiple linear regression models with year in college as a control:

- Environmental predictors model
- Educational background predictors model

Interaction terms were excluded to limit overfitting and keep interpretation clear.

### Key Findings
Year in college was the strongest and most consistent positive predictor in both models.  
In the environmental model, higher PM2.5 and larger ZIP-code area were associated with modestly lower SKS.  
In the educational model, higher neighborhood college-degree attainment was associated with higher SKS.

### Interpretation and Limitations
Results suggest institutional exposure (curriculum/time in college) may matter more than background environment alone. This is associative, not causal, and uncertainty remains due to self-selection and ZIP-code-level aggregation.

### Tools
R (linear modeling, data visualization), census and environmental datasets.
