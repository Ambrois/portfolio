An in-progress exploration of black hole visualization written in C++, SFML, and GLSL. Each pixel launches a light ray, integrates the Schwarzschild null geodesic equations with adaptive-step RK4, and shades based on what the ray hits (star field, accretion disk, photon ring, or the singularity).

## How it works
- Rays are marched in 2D on the equatorial plane and rotated into 3D to leverage spherical symmetry.
- Numerical integration uses adaptive-step RK4 to keep curved light paths stable near the horizon.
- Shading pulls from simple models: a background star map, disk temperature to approximate black-body color, and object bounds for debugging.

## Recent milestones
- Added background stars and more realistic disk color via temperature-based black-body approximation.
- Photon ring resolves cleanly in the most recent render.
- Object bounds rendering and earlier Euclidean engine provided scaffolding before moving fully to curved spacetime.

## Next steps to explore
- Improve behavior at the center where phi-parameterization breaks down; adapt step size with respect to phi.
- Implement parallel transport so camera orientation stays stable while moving.
- Refine the accretion disk (flare the shape, lean on intersection data instead of skipped segments).
