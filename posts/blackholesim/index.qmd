### Introduction

TODO

- Using C++, SFML, and GLSL
  - my first C++ and graphics project so please forgive strange and bad design choices
- The simulation marches a grid of light rays (one per pixel) from the camera and numerically approximates the null geodesic equations for the Schwarzschild metric. The light rays curve and hit objects, which determine the color of the pixel.
  - numerical approximation is done via RK4 with adaptive step size
- For efficiency of computation, and accurate due to spherical symmetry of the SC spacetime, null geodesics are computed in 2D on the equator and rotated into place in 3D.

### Milestone Screenshots

TODO add screen recording

- Added background stars
- Made disk color more realistic: calculate temp -> approximate black body radiation -> color
- Photon ring visible

### Next Steps:
- the center of the bh has trouble rendering bc parameterizing with phi, make step size also adjust for phi
- if you move, your camera turns because I've yet to implement parallel transport of the camera directions
- accretion disk
  - should be flared out bc intertia
  - needs to use intersections fully, the ray skipped segments are noticable
